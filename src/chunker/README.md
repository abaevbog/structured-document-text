# Passage chunker

The optional `src/chunker/` module splits one materialized PDF, EPUB or snapshot
SDT into source excerpts, embedding input and serializable source anchors. Treat the input
as immutable. These passages are separate from SDT pack storage chunks.

## Usage

```js
import { getChunks } from 'structured-document-text/src/chunker/index.js';

const chunks = getChunks(structure);
for (const chunk of chunks) {
    // Use chunk.embedText for embeddings and chunk.text as the source excerpt.
    if (chunk.anchor === null) {
        throw new Error(`Cannot map chunk: ${chunk.text}`);
    }
    const saved = JSON.stringify(chunk.anchor);
    // Persist saved with the embedding's document context.
}
```

For a saved result, recover covered text for its preview. Request Reader positions
only when navigating or highlighting that result:

```js
import { getAnchorContent, getAnchorPositions } from 'structured-document-text/src/chunker/index.js';

const anchor = JSON.parse(savedAnchorJSON);
const recovered = getAnchorContent(structure, anchor);
if (recovered === null) {
    throw new Error(`Cannot recover chunk anchor: ${savedAnchorJSON}`);
}
// recovered is { text, outlinePath, pageLabel }; its text can differ from the original excerpt.
const positions = getAnchorPositions(structure, anchor);
if (positions === null) {
    throw new Error(`Cannot resolve Reader positions: ${savedAnchorJSON}`);
}
```

For text alone, import `getTextChunks` from `src/chunker/text.js`. It accepts the
same options and returns the same fields except `anchor`, without loading
position mappers or decoding geometry. Both entry points export `CHUNKER_VERSION`;
the package root and `src/read.js` do not load the chunker.

For a preliminary progress total, use `getChunkCount(structure, options)` from
either entry point. It shares the same selection and splitting rules and returns
the same count as `getTextChunks()` or `getChunks()`, including chunks whose anchor
would be `null`. It skips chunk output construction, final per-chunk token estimates,
location metadata and result sorting. Counting still performs text selection and
splitting; it does not retain a plan for a later chunking call. Use the same
immutable structure and options for both calls.

For plain text with no structure, both entry points export `getPlainTextChunks(text, options)`.
Blank lines separate its paragraphs; a single newline is a wrapped line and a form
feed a page break, so both read as a space. It returns what `getTextChunks` returns.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `text` | Selected source excerpt. |
| `embedText` | Embedding input with selected outline paths inserted at section boundaries. |
| `tokens` | Rounded, script-based estimate for the complete `embedText`; not a model token count. |
| `outlinePath` | Path at the first selected text; a chunk can cross sections. |
| `pageLabel` | First selected page's label, or a one-based PDF page ordinal. `null` when unavailable or for synthetic EPUB locations. |
| `sectionPart`, `sectionParts` | One-based passage number and total within a split group, which may combine short sections. |
| `auxiliary` | Whether the chunk belongs to a separate auxiliary group. |
| `anchor` | Serializable source coverage; `null` if mapping fails. Present only with `getChunks`. |

See [text types](text.d.ts) and [anchor types](anchors.d.ts) for the API.
The former `getNextChunk()` API is replaced by array iteration.

## Sizing

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `includeAuxiliary` | Include separate auxiliary chunks, such as captions and footnotes. Defaults to `false`; body chunks are unchanged. |
| `maxTokens` | Estimated `embedText` token ceiling, including context. Defaults to 768; integer ≥ 2. |
| `maxSize` | Alternative hard `embedText` ceiling in UTF-16 code units; integer ≥ 2. Cannot be combined with `maxTokens`. |
| `minSize` | Preferred source-text minimum in UTF-16 code units. `0` disables short-section grouping. |
| `overlap` | Maximum overlap in UTF-16 code units; paragraph-boundary splits do not overlap. |

Automatic defaults are approximately 120 tokens for the minimum and 48 for
overlap. Below `maxTokens: 768`, both scale down proportionally; at 64 tokens,
the minimum is approximately 10 tokens and overlap is 4. With `maxSize`, these
defaults are 120/768 and 48/768 of that character ceiling, rounded down.

```js
import { getTextChunks } from 'structured-document-text/src/chunker/text.js';

getChunks(structure, { maxTokens: 459 });
getTextChunks(structure, { maxSize: 3000, minSize: 450, overlap: 180 });
```

Explicit `minSize` and `overlap` must be nonnegative integers that fit the
calculated character budget (`minSize <= budget`, `overlap < budget`).
Invalid options throw `TypeError`. With automatic sizing, this budget depends
on the text; use `maxSize` when you need fixed character limits.

Heading context shares the budget with source text and may be omitted to leave
room for it. Token limits use a script-based heuristic, so consumers must still
enforce their model's actual token limit.

## Text selection

- Reference blocks and `flowClass: 'excluded'` blocks are omitted with their subtrees.
- Auxiliary blocks are omitted by default. Use `{ includeAuxiliary: true }` with
  either chunking entry point to include them. Classification is inherited through
  containers. Auxiliary groups stay separate from body text and other auxiliary
  roots. Within each outline section,
  body text stays together across auxiliary blocks.
- Short adjacent body sections accumulate into groups; a short trailing group joins
  the previous body group. Final chunks are ordered by their first selected source
  position, so split body and auxiliary passages can interleave.
- Complete headings directly targeted by the outline are replaced with context
  only when their titles match after whitespace normalization and the context fits.
  Other headings stay in the excerpt. Standalone headings are retained; matching
  headings whose body consists entirely of references are omitted.

Both entry points omit text without source anchors before sizing. PDF text nodes
need their own nonempty `textMap`; block maps and rectangles are not substitutes.
EPUB and snapshot text can use a containing element anchor for synthetic content,
such as an image description. Whitespace-only nodes need no anchor. Older PDF code
blocks without text-node maps need re-extraction to become indexable.

Splitting balances the remaining text across the estimated number of remaining
chunks, preferring paragraphs, sentences, whitespace, then code-point boundaries.
Overlap prefers whole sentences, then word boundaries, and may shorten for
progress. Sentence detection uses `Intl.Segmenter` with the `en` locale and can
vary with the runtime's Unicode rules.

Ordinary block edges are trimmed; in-block whitespace and preformatted indentation
are preserved. Blocks are separated by two newlines. Consecutive selected parts
linked by `nextPart` or `previousPart` join with a space, or a newline for code
when neither part supplies one. Tiny budgets can omit whitespace-only slices.

## Anchors, Reader positions and recovery

A chunk's durable addresses are source-document anchors, never SDT block
indexes, node paths or references to a particular extraction. Chunks can be
copied, serialized or transferred between workers.

- **PDF:** `{ pageRects: [[pageIndex, left, bottom, right, top], ...] }`, including
  all selected pages. Nearby lines and same-line fragments in the same paragraph
  or list item, page and horizontal column can share a region only when its full
  bounding box, expanded by recovery tolerance, does not intersect unrelated
  text's line rectangles. Unselected portions of lines count as unrelated.
  Missing line geometry uses conservative block bounds; unknown coverage prevents
  consolidation. Other block types and uncertain/rotated layouts retain their
  existing fine rectangles. Saved coordinates snap to six decimal places only
  when the change is at most `1e-9` PDF points, removing arithmetic tails while
  retaining finer geometry. Merge checks and Reader positions use decoded precision.
  No compression is applied.
- **EPUB:** `{ selectors: [...] }` containing `FragmentSelector` CFI ranges, separated at omissions and content-file
  boundaries. Whole elements use CFIs without character offsets.
- **Snapshot:** `{ selectors: [...] }` containing body-relative `TextPositionSelector` ranges for source text,
  separated at omissions and source gaps. Synthetic content uses `CssSelector`
  element anchors. Recovery also accepts existing CSS selectors and refinements.

If a present anchor cannot be mapped, `getChunks()` keeps the text with
`anchor: null`. Unsupported processors and unexpected programming errors throw. Synthetic text may select an
entire element even when the chunk contains only part of its description.

`getAnchorContent(structure, anchor)` resolves saved anchors against the
supplied SDT, orders and deduplicates the covered text, and applies the whitespace
rules above. It returns `{ text, outlinePath, pageLabel }`, the section and page
being those at the first recovered text, as the chunker names them at its first
selected text. It does not rerun chunking or exclusion policy. Empty, malformed or
mixed-format anchors return `null`. Every represented PDF page must resolve some
text, though individual rectangles on a surviving page may become empty. Every
DOM selector must resolve; one failed selector returns `null` for the whole anchor.
A valid whitespace-only DOM selection can return `""` after
ordinary-text trimming; preformatted whitespace is preserved.

`getAnchorPositions(structure, anchor)` restores ordinary PDF line rectangles,
one `{ pageIndex, rects }` position per selected page, or returns copies of DOM
selectors. It preserves disjoint selections and supports any number of pages.
DOM conversion validates selector shape and format, but does not verify text
recovery or Reader resolution: usable navigation selectors can coexist with
`getAnchorContent() === null`. Treat failed recovery as a failure, never as empty
text or a reason to silently substitute the original excerpt.

Store the anchor as plain JSON or in its compact form below, and derive Reader
positions when needed; storing expanded line positions too loses the storage benefit. This replaces the PR's
`chunk.positions` and `getPositionsText()` API. Ordinary Reader Position shapes
are unchanged; `nextPageRects` and `nextPageIndex` are not anchor fields.

Recovery can include surrounding text or change after re-extraction. A later
extraction may recognize new text inside a consolidated PDF region. EPUB offsets
are translated through `deltaMap` and clamped within the resolved text-node part
if it becomes shorter. Snapshot recovery accepts selections extending beyond
extracted coverage. Anchors alone do not preserve the exact original excerpt
or embedding input.

### Compact storage

`compactAnchor(anchor)` returns a `Uint8Array` for storing many anchors, and
`expandAnchor(bytes)` reads it back. PDF rectangles become a delta-coded varint
stream in tenths of a point, about a quarter of their JSON size. Coordinates
round outward to that grid, so an expanded rectangle can be up to 0.1 pt larger
on each side and never smaller; recovery selects only glyphs wholly inside a
rectangle, so it changes only for a glyph that fits entirely within that margin.
Expanded rectangles come back grouped by page, in order of first appearance.
Any other anchor, including `null`, is kept as JSON and round-trips exactly.
The first byte names the form, so the format can change without invalidating
stored bytes.

### Snapshot text positions and HTML parsing

The snapshot extractor and the Reader's browser can build different element trees
from the same HTML. For example, the extractor's DOM map can contain `table > tr`,
while the browser inserts `tbody` and renders `table > tbody > tr`. A CSS selector
generated from the extractor's tree can therefore recover text correctly inside
SDT but match nothing in the Reader.

The chunker uses the existing body text stream for ordinary text positions instead
of generating CSS paths from that tree. Offsets are in original-source UTF-16 units;
`deltaMap` translates normalized SDT offsets back to that stream. Each disjoint
selected range gets its own position, so skipped headings, references and other
omissions are not pulled into a single broad range. Synthetic content such as an
image description has no body-text offsets and still selects its containing
element through a CSS anchor. Existing CSS positions remain readable.

This avoids tree-only differences such as an inserted `tbody`, without changing
the position shapes, chunk text, embedding input or SDT schema. It assumes the same
source file and body text order. Inserting text earlier in an edited HTML file
shifts body offsets; browser repairs that reorder text can also invalidate them.
Consumers must validate source identity. Synthetic element selectors remain
subject to differences between the extractor's and browser's trees.

For a broader future solution, document-worker's snapshot parser and DOM indexing
could follow browser HTML tree-construction rules, with text-stream accounting
consistent with the Reader. Before returning to element-relative text selectors,
test generated positions against the actual rendered source HTML, including
implicit table elements and malformed markup; SDT-only round trips cannot detect
this mismatch. Existing cached extractions would need the normal processor refresh
policy after such a producer change. Avoid table-specific selector rewrites in
the chunker: other browser tree repairs would remain unresolved.

## Integration limits

- Wholly synthetic EPUB elements need a Reader adapter to expand their CFIs to
  visible ranges; the current Reader resolves these to collapsed ranges.
- Mixed EPUB paragraphs with synthetic endpoints retain an existing CFI defect;
  wrapping their selectors does not correct it. That correction is separate.
- EPUB extraction can omit normalization offsets. The chunker tolerates shortened
  endpoints but cannot reconstruct missing shifts within text. Fixing those maps
  belongs in document-worker; see [recovery tests](../../test/chunker/epub-recovery.test.js).
- PDF recovery selects glyphs fully contained in the saved rectangles, with
  0.01-point tolerance. Fully overlapping and zero-width boundary glyphs can
  still add neighboring text. Re-extraction that moves glyph bounds beyond
  this tolerance can omit boundary text or make recovery fail. Reconstructed
  Reader positions reflect this approximate recovery; the original embedding
  input is unchanged. Focused [recovery tests](../../test/chunker/pdf-recovery.test.js)
  cover containment and boundary shifts.

Consumers own Reader navigation/highlighting, embedding storage, source validation
and refresh policy. Bound live parsed SDTs and processing concurrency in the
consumer; the two-page barrier cache does not bound decoded glyph geometry.
Retaining serialized anchors does not require keeping their SDTs alive.
Record chunking options with `CHUNKER_VERSION`, which versions
text selection, embedding formatting and defaults. Position-only fixes do not
change it; processor, schema and pack versions are separate. The chunker does not
run semantic search or regenerate embeddings.

## Development

`index.js` and `text.js` are the supported entry points; other files are private.
Text selection and splitting live in `chunks.js`/`split.js`; source mapping uses
a shared document index and one mapper per format.

Run `npm test` from the repository root with Node.js 24 or newer. Tests in
[test/chunker](../../test/chunker/) cover API behavior, text/anchor fixtures and
recovery exceptions.
